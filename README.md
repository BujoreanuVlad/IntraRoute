# IntraRoute project

 The IntraRoute project is meant to mimic the way in which an intranet network might
try to find the path with the smallest latency. Keep in mind however that this project is
meant to teach people about pathfinding algorithms in an oriented graph rather than build
and actual functioning component of an intranet network. As such, a lot of decisions made
in the design of the program are made with the goal of teaching instead of creating a 
real-world functioning program.
